# Alpha 0.0!

**We are currently planning this project. Soon, it will have features, and be usable.**

A Rust library for creating, launching, and managing Minecraft instances.

This isn't our top priority right now, first we'll need authentication, so we're working on msmc.rs first.

Will include support for:

- Vanilla
- Fabric
- Forge
- Quilt
- Modrinth Modpacks
- Curseforge Modpacks
